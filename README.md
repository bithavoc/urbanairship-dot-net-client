# UrbanAirship .NET Client

This is an un-official [CLI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Infrastructure) client for the [UrbanAirship](http://urbanairship.com/) platform.

## Supported API
UrbanAirship supports many platforms including iOS, Android and RIM. However, this library only supports iOS at this time.

Contributions are welcome.

## Usage

### Configuration

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <configuration>
      <configSections>
        <section name="UrbanAirship" type="UrbanAirship.Configuration.UrbanAirshipSection, UrbanAirship" />
      </configSections>
      <UrbanAirship applicationKey="APP_KEY" applicationSecret="APP_SECRET"/>
    </configuration>

### Sending a Push Notification iOS

    Client client = new Client(); // Uses Application Configuration File
    client.iOS.RegisterDevice("Some Device Token");
    PushNotification notification = client.CreatePush();
    notification.iOS.Alert = "Hello World";
    notification.DeviceTokens.Add("Some Device Token");
    notification.Send();

### Sending a Push Notification android

    Client client = new Client(); // Uses Application Configuration File
    client.GCM.RegisterDevice("Some Apid");
    PushNotification notification = client.CreatePush();
    notification.GCMPushDetails.Alert = "Hello World";
    notification.GoogleApids.Add("Some Device Token");
    notification.Send();

### Sending a Push Notification cross plaftorm using alias

    Client client = new Client(); // Uses Application Configuration File
    client.GCM.RegisterDevice("Some google Apid", "someAlias@urbanAirshipClient.com");
	client.iOS.RegisterDevice("Some iOS Device Token", "AnotherAlias@urbanAirshipClient.com");
    PushNotification notification = client.CreatePush();
    notification.GoogleGCMDetails.Alert = "Hello World";
	notification.iOS.Alert = "Hello World";
    notification.Aliases.Add("someAlias@urbanAirshipClient.com");
	notification.Aliases.Add("AnotherAlias@urbanAirshipClient.com");
    notification.Send();

### Sending Custom Values


In order to send custom values as part of the notification, you need to create a sub class of PushNotification and decorate it with DataContract and DataMember attributes.

    [DataContract]
    class helloPush : PushNotification
    {
        [DataMember]
        public string myCustomMessage
        {
            get;
            set;
        }
    }

Create an instance of the notification:

    helloPush notification = client.CreatePush<helloPush>();
    notification.myCustomMessage = "Hello There"
